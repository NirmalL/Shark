Packet capturing, analyzing and extraction of security related data in Java.
(Not a fork of the deprecated *SharkHunt* project)

Developer working environment: _IntelliJ IDEA (community), jNetPcap, JavaFX, Windows 8.1_

### (planned) development milestones or **features**

- [x] read offline **(captured to file)** packets
- [x] extract them to memory and store **(in-memory)** efficiently
- [x] filter them dynamicallly and efficiently
- [x] JavaFX GUI
- [ ] live capturing &mdash; [ @MadushaJ ](https://github.com/madushaj "Madusha's GitHub"), [ @NirmalL ](https://github.com/NirmalL "Nirmal's GitHub")
- [ ] documentation &mdash; [ @NarmadaBalasooriya ](https://github.com/NarmadaBalasooriya "Narmada's GitHub")
- [ ] **(enhancements)**

These are just the initial goals. Once they're accomplished, we'll be moving on to much more interesting and hacking-related stuff.

Currently, this is being developed under academic-project restrictions; but in a month, 
the codebase and the ideas will be open to the general public. :-)
